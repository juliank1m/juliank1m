# Hey, I’m Julian 👋

I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo who enjoys building things, learning how they work, and slowly making them better.

This is where I experiment, break ideas, and turn curiosity into projects.

## What you’ll find here

A mix of:
- personal projects that grew beyond their original scope  
- experiments in systems, games, and machine learning  
- tools I’m building because I they seemed fun to build or were required for an issue I came across
- works-in-progress that are still finding their shape  

If something looks unfinished, it probably is. Lots going on!
