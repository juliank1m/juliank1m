# Hey, I’m Julian 👋

I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo who enjoys building things, learning how they work, and slowly making them better.

This is where I experiment, break ideas, and turn curiosity into projects.

## What you’ll find here

A mix of:
- personal projects that grew beyond their original scope  
- experiments in systems, games, and machine learning  
- tools I’m building because I they seemed fun to build or were required for an issue I came across
- works-in-progress that are still finding their shape  

If something looks unfinished, it probably is. Lots going on!

## Projects I care about

### 🧗 PyClimb  
An interactive Python learning platform focused on clarity and progression rather than flashy gamification.

This is a long-term project where I experiment with how people learn and how software can support that.

---

### 🌐 juliankim.dev  
My personal website and a small playground for design and deployment ideas.

It’s where I document what I’m working on and try out layouts, typography, and UI ideas without pressure.

---

### 🎮 MonoGame Experiments  
Game projects built with MonoGame.

These projects help me understand game loops, rendering, input systems, and performance — more about learning than shipping.

---

### 🤖 PokéRogue AI Environment (WIP)  
A work-in-progress reinforcement learning environment in PokéRogue.

I’m using this to learn about environment design, state representation, and how agents interact with complex systems.

## Tools I use

**Languages**  
Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, C, C++, C#

**Frameworks & Libraries**  
React, Next.js, Django, Flask
